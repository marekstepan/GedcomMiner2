# GedcomMiner2

This repository contains the basis for an application 
that populates the postgres database with genealogical data 
from the input gedcom file, selects the direct ancestors 
of the selected individual, and divides the ancestors into branches. 
I created the application very soon after learning just the basics of java scripting,
so currently both internal and external code quality are amazingly catastrophic.

Plans for future:
refactoring
new analytical functions
new output filtering functions
frontend with map interface
